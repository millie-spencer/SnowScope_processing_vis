This script was developed during the CUAHSI Snow School (Granby, CO) to analyze snow characteristics near the Berthoud Pass SNOTEL site. 
We made snow strength and depth measurements with the Snow Scope tool by Propogration Labs: https://propagation-labs.gitbook.io/propagation-labs-user-manual. 
We assessed how snow harness varies with vertical snow depth and how bulk hardness varies by distance from trees. 
We also dug snow pits coincident with Snow Scope samples to analyze the snow stratigraphy. We document snow depth, layer stratigraphy (depth range for each layer) and grain type. 
Finally, we analyzed layer average hardness (measured by Snow Scope) by grain type (visually identified in snow pits). 

DISCLAIMER: 
Our analysis tiook place over the course of several hours on Jan 8, 2026. Given the time shortage, any correlations and conclusions should be used with caution. 
More data are needed to make any conclusive claims!! 

Feel free to use or modify this script to conduct similar analyses!
